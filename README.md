This program generates large, random byte streams.
It is a refactored, faster version of the randall program from the Free Software Foundation Inc. 
<https://fsf.org/>

## Installation
```bash
make
```
## Usage
```bash
./randall -i [INPUT] -o [OUTPUT] M
```

Outputs M randomly generated bytes  


Where INPUT is one of the following:  

rdrand – the hardware random-number generation supported by x86-64 processors, if available.  
randall will issue an error message and fail if it is not available. This option is the default.  

mrand48_r – the mrand48_r function of the GNU C library.  

/F (i.e., any argument beginning with /) – use the file /F as a source of random data  


Where OUTPUT is one of the following:  

stdio – Use stdio output, as before. This is the default.  

N (a positive decimal integer) – Output N KiB bytes at a time
